# Getting Started with dunicn-epg-app

This project, an EPG react application, is a part of a code test for Norigin Media.
I've user ReactQuery to fetch the data from already provided mock-api and styled-components for styling. The app is responsive.

To install and run it: 

```
npx create-dunicn-epg-app your-project-name

cd your-project-name && npm start
```
